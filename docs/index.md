# Introduction

## Overview

`ipybox` is a lightweight and secure Python code execution sandbox based on [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can run it locally on your computer or remotely in an environment of your choice - no API key required.

Designed for AI agents that interact with their environment through code execution, like [`freeact`](https://gradion-ai.github.io/freeact/) agents, it is also well-suited for many other secure code execution use cases. `ipybox` is fully open-source and distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
